        Last.fm with Friends is an <a href="https://github.com/neilmenon/lastfm-with-friends" target="_blank">open-source</a> project that is powered by the <a href="https://www.last.fm/api" target="_blank">Last.fm API</a>. I initially created this to use with my housemates to see what our favorite artists were, and then I slowly built it out into a full-fledged tool with lots of random features I found useful. I never wanted to recreate the same features found on Last.fm but rather use Last.fm's awesome service to transform music stats into a group context. The project was developed on an Angular / Flask / NGINX / MariaDB stack and it's currently self-hosted.
