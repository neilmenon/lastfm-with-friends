    About Group Sessions
</h2> 

<div class="color-clear" style="font-size: 15px;">
    <p>
        Ever been listening with a friend but miss out on the scrobbles? Group sessions are a handy feature built in-house that allow you to join and create listening sessions with your friends. Sessions are "follow the leader": everyone that joins a session gets any new scrobbles that the session owner scrobbles.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you <strong><u>create</u></strong> a group session, everyone in the group can see and join your session. When you <strong><u>end</u></strong> the group session, the session ends for everyone. As session owner, you also have the ability to <strong><u>kick</u></strong> members from the session. This can be useful in case someone leaves the room/music but forgets to leave the session.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you <strong><u>join</u></strong> an existing session, you start tracking the session owner's scrobbles, and <em>only</em> their scrobbles. You may leave the session at any point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group session scrobbler framework is currently being run every <strong><u>1 minute</u></strong>. That means it will take this amount of time to receive scrobbles from the session owner.

    <h3>Bonus features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Been listening with the session owner for a while but forgot to join the session? Use the <em>catch up your scrobbles</em> feature to select the first track you heard. The app will get you up to speed with the session.</li>
        <li>Your Last.fm now playing status will also track with the session owner (note: your now playing status in the Listening Activity box may be slightly behind this due to how often the app fetches your now playing track).</li>
        <li>You can follow an individual user's scrobbles without having to ask them to create a session! Just choose the <em>follow individual user</em> option.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        Last.fm with Friends is not responsible for group sessions left unattended and/or any unintended scrobbles being attributed to any user in a session. By using this feature, you are giving Last.fm with Friends permission to scrobble tracks on your behalf. In an effort to uphold the integrity of Last.fm scrobbles, sessions will automatically expire if the last played track  exceeds 90 minutes, after the session has existed for more than 30 minutes.
